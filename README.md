ViSi-Genie-Particle-Library
==============================================================

Particle Photon Library for 4D Systems ViSi-Genie Environment

This library support for neagative numbers, unsigned longs, unsigned integers with the WriteStr function.
This library features enhanced String Writing capability, no longer is a character Array the only viable option. 
This library included support for the Workshop4 PRO features.
This library has support for 2+ displays connected to a single Particle Photon, and adds a Demo to illustrate how that is achieved.
This library also supports the internal/inherent widgets of Workshop4

## Information

This library provides high level functions for the Particle Photon, to ease communication with 4D Systems modules when using the module configured with ViSi-Genie.
This library is a version of 4D Systems ViSi-Genie-Arduino library (genieArduino) adapted for the Spark/Photon. The library is designed to use any (hardware) Serial port. On the Spark, this would be Serial1 or Serial2.
Workshop4 PRO adds additional features to ViSi-Genie, allowing the User to write 4DGL code which can be executed at will from ViSi-Genie, enabling many advanced features not previously possible.
Please refer to the 4D Systems website, namingly the Workshop 4 Product Page, for documentation regarding Workshop 4, and its environments.

## Example Sketch

Inside the library are multiple example sketches, to assist with getting started using this library. Inside is also a ViSi-Genie Workshop4 project, which can be used on a range of 4D Systems displays (designed on a uLCD-32PTU however can be changed via Workshop4 menu). It illustrates how to use some of the commands in the library include Read Object, Write Object, Reported Messages, Write Contrast and Write String.

## Tested with

This library has been tested on the Particle Photon.
Any problems discovered with this library, please contact technical support so fixes can be put in place, or seek support from our forum.

## Compatible 4D Systems Display Modules

This library will work with all 4D Systems Modules which are capable of using the ViSi-Genie environment. This is therefore all Picaso and Diablo16 Display Modules.
The demo included with this library was made for the uLCD-32PTU however can easily be adapted to other size displays.
